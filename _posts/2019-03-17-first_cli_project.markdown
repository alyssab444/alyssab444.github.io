When we first entered into the realm of our first cli project I had but one emotion, anxiety. Which is a feeling that has definitely stuck with me untill the end. The only difference now is that I am being flooded with other emotions as well. Fear, anger, envy, and sadness reared their ugly heads from time to time (most times actually). However, the times that I expeirenced the positive emotions like happiness, surprise (I can't believe I finally got that to work!),  and even love; it was those moments that I relished and that powered me through this rocky road. It's interesting how coding can be sort of therapeutic. In that it forces you to look inward at yourself and really analyze each peice. I had plenty of the "Oh man, have I made a mistake in choosing this path?" and  "Why am I not getting this and other people are?" but it's the perserverance and support from my cohort lead and fellow students that keep pushing me through. Although I still do feel like I need to have a second go round with the ruby language, I am looking at my progress today and where I was at on day one. I am leaps and bounds ahead of where I was at on day one and that is the important aspect I am trying to remember.
