I had a revelation by the end of my second project at Flatiron School. After completing this Sinatra project and gaining a deeper understanding of how the web works, my thirst for code has grown. And from that, I now have an extra pep in my step and a brighter outlook on the rest of my journey at Flatiron. Perhaps it was the simplicity and intuitivness of Sinatra that brought back my enthusiasim. The MVC framework of Sinatra appeals to my need for organization. Having each part of the application divided  based on their function is a feature i love about Sinatra. Oh and shotgun is, AMAZING. Being able to see changes you make to your code right there on a web page opened my eyes and finally made what I'm doing seem real. 

The tricky part was getting started. It always is. Luckily, we had the corneal gem to bundle install into our application which created the MVC framework for us. After I created the route controllers for the user it got a bit trickier when I moved onto my trip route controller. This involved using CRUD actions for the routes. It was actually very interesting learning how one would create, read, update, and delete data from a website. I have done this countless times as a user so to be able to actually see how it is done was pretty satisfying. 

It's not just about the routes though. We need to make sure we are able to render our information to the web page after a get, post or patch request. That's where the .erb files come in handy. Being able to intertwine the views .erb files with the controller files definitley helps to abstract the code written in the controller file. And then being able to write Ruby code in the .erb files by using the substitution tags and scripting tag was also very helpful. 

I would also say I thoroughly enjoyed styling my application a bit with some CSS once I was finished making my routes functional. Especailly with using shotgun to automatically update the browser and keep the server running. Seeing those changes in realtime speeds up programming. This project experience has definitely helped me not only gain more of an understanding of how to code but also actually begin to love to code. Looking forward to more!
