Wow.


I would say this Rails project was where I started venturing into challenging territory. Not only because the nature of some of the requirements (don't even get me started on omniauth) but because of what life threw at me around the time I was working on this project. With rails, I started to really feel like a developer. Not only being able to see changes I made to code in real time but also being able to debug DIRECTLY IN THE BROWSER. Plently of magic wrapped up in Rails. 

I loved getting to research further into all the gems that are at my fingertips as well as all the built-in methods Rails has to offer. You truely get to see how you can literally do anything you would like when creating an application. My challenge was definitely getting past the omniauth requirement. It lead me down a rabbit hole of different errors on top of different errors. BUT the feeling I got when I finally got past it, there's nothing like it. 

Aside from challenges related with the project, life's challenges are always that extra cherry on top. If coding wasn't challenging enough, there's the challenge of trying to make it mesh with what's already going on in your life. However, I think that makes me appreciate Flatiron even more. The instructors and educational coaches really are there for you when you feel like all is lost. Always there to say, "You got this!"
